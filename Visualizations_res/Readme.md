 The figures here (Semantics of ADT-1, Semantics of ADT-2, Semantics of ADT-3, Semantics of ADT-4, Semantics of ADT-5, Semantics of ADT-6, Semantics of ADT-7, Semantics of ADT-8) presents sample illustrations alongside attention maps (values extracted from the Cross-Attention layer of the Text/Video Parser and normalized) for each multiview embedding from ADT-1 to ADT-8, where darker hues indicate higher attention weights. For caption, words receiving the highest attention under each ADT are highlighted in red, while the most attended video frames are outlined with red boxes. Consistent with the main paper's configuration, videos are uniformly sampled at 64 frames; for visual clarity, frames are grouped into sets of 8 in the figures.
